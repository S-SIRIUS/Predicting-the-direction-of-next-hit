       "'   As survival series go, \"Squid Game\" brought with it something familiar - a game-show setting with a mindblowing cash prize for the winner - and infused it with a \"Hunger Games\", \"Saw\", and other story-telling flavours that felt human in several regards                                                                                                        The show made me genuinely feel for and think about the people involved instead of just watching them go through what they did like an inert spectator                                                                                                                                                                                   The stakes were high, but so were the perils - especially of the moral kind                                                                                                   The parts where they delved into the Human psyche and captured multiple facets of what different kinds of people are willing to do to win financial freedom                                                                                                                                        This part, more than anything else, made this Korean survival-thriller series feel at once relatable and well-scripted                                                                                                   The show came close to relying on clichì±\\x95d tropes and boring plot-elements, but somehow Dong-hyuk Hwang evaded all those loopholes and convenience zones                                                                                                                                                                   He also scripted the series, adding to his credence as a visual communicator extraordinaire                                                                                                                                                                                         Every cast member was excellent, and their performances were on point                                                                                                                                                          Neither one eclipsed the other, in fact each brought something significant to bear on this storyline                                                                                                                                                                                   The thrills were carried on their performances, and they all did great work                                                                                                                                                                         Jaeil Jungs musical scoring more than made it work where this series was concerned                                                                                                                                                                                            He captured all the right emotions by hitting all the right notes                                                                                                                                                                                                         That ominous choir-orchestra tone he relied on often                                                                                                                                                                                                That never got old, and routinely perked my sense of suspense                                                                                                                                                                                            Great work also on set and production design, as well as costumes                                                        These, and other crew departments, including cinematography (strangely unlisted on IMDB), conveyed a sense of complexity and elaborateness by keeping it counter-intuitively simple and theme-centric                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              A few negatives                                                                                                                                                                                                                       There were no cameras in the restrooms                                                                                                                                                            This particular place given its peculiar goings-on should have certainly had them installed there                                                                                                                                                                                       No cavity checks of the prisoners -
