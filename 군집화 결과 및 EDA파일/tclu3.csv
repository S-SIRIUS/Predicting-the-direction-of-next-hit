4,4,"  I honestly dont know wtf the main character needed to go into the room where the old man was, dye his hair red and not attempting to board the plane               At the beginning I was having expectations that it would be thrillingly good which it was but the ending just didnt do it for me chief                                                                                                                    ",1,82.45614035087719,3
