93,93,"      Episode 1 was AMAZING!!!But things went downhill a little bit each episode                                            By episode 4, I was totally over it  I did watch all 9 episodes, because Id already invested so much time into it                 Plus, I wanted to see what all the social media hype was about                         unfortunately, after all 9 episodes, Im not seeing it                                          Didnt really need to be 9 hours long                           would of worked better as one regular 90-minute film                                               ",0,79.24528301886792,2
