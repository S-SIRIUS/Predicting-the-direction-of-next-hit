However, this story paints the loves of the participants in a way that is often boring, uninteresting, and downright unbelievable    Honestly, none of the characters act like real people, and there are several GLARING plot holes and nonsensical plot points to boot; for example, 456 people go missing at the exact same time, staying missing for three days, 255 of them NEVER RETURNED, and absolutely nobody, anywhere, seems to notice what should be an international headline (except for one detective who decides to investigate it off the books, who conveniently informs noone of his investigation or wherabouts                                                                                                                  As well, I couldnt write about this show without discussing the insane premise that it relies upon: that all of our main characters decided to take part in a game that would kill all but one of them, and all participants are made aware of this fact, and despite that meaning that they and the people they met during the first game have virtually no chance of survival                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  And yet, all of them act as if it isnt the case                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Only 3% of the people who were unknowingly thrust into a lethal game and witnessed 225 people killed before their very eyes decided that their problems werent bad enough to warrant throwing their lives away in a game that only one person could survive                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Bulls**t                                                                                                                                                                               Everyone with a family and loved ones, everybody who voted to end the games after the first session of bloody horror, all of them determined that they in fact had no reason to live or were going to die anyway, and that the only way normal life would be feasible is if they give the murder games another shot                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Who cares about the odds, amiright?

                                         Not to mention how they tell them at first the winners can share the money amongst them and midway they change it to only one can stay alive and get all the money for himself

personal lives it feels like vapid emotional manipulation, since you are never given any reason to assume they can win because they deserve it

many and dont matter in the longrun since the winner was predetermined                                                                                                                                                Not only that, the last episode desperately tries to offer social commentary and to be deep about humanity and kindness                                                                         It all falls flat on its face because its too late to do anything about it, it is told to the predetermined winner, and is told by a guy who was fooling around and then pretended to be dead

were told what is at stake right away and there was a lot more strategy and deception instead of gory deaths based on luck

that he would at least make it to the final game, if not win it    It would have been better had they given 10 mins in the first episode to tell the backstories of Gi Hun, Sang Woo, Sae Byeok, Ali, Deok Su and Mi Hyeon, so that it would appear each of them have an equal chance at winning
