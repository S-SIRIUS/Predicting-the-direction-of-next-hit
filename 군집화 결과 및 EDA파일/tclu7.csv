Very interesting story and characters UNTIL the last episode   I just could have done without the boo hoo blah blah sentimental ""here is why"" explanation                                                                   I believe that was obvious             The most worthy of friendships in the game was ruined for me in the last episode                                                                              Its worth a go                  It teaches age old lessons again but its always worth learning them, again                                                             ",1,68.18181818181817,7
