248,248,"  With a premise similar to the likes of Cube and Circle, the odd titled Squid Game helps us question humanity all over again as well as the importance society places on money                                                   As dark and violent as Battle Royal and intriguing as 3% it grabs your attention early on and keeps you guessing to the end                                                                                                           Great binge worthy series with a likeable cast and main protagonist                                        Knocked off one point as I didnt love the ending but otherwise a really great TV series with some great ideas and worthy of top marks                                                                                                      Season 2? Personally I think it works better as a one off but then again                                                                                                                                                ",1,57.14285714285714,0
